- We feel most natural and fulfilled if we conduct activities in the order of each person's functional stack each day. 
- If miss to do activities related to dominant and auxiliary functions, we feel something is wrong and that day is not well lived

## Internal Observation
- Doing open research first thing in the morning feels overwhelming; while wringing [[Daily Notes/Evergreen Notes\|Evergreen Notes]] at night feels exhausting. 
- Social and doing chores first thing in the day both feel wrong and dissatisfying. 

## Discussion
- Why does "Eat the Frog First only work for some people"?
	- If the frog task matches the dominant function, low resistance and work; if miss matches, then it occurs with high resistance and won't stick
	- According to this Theory, My Dominant function is Ti (reductive logic), and the auxiliary function is Ne (Open exploring and sidetracking), therefore I should switch orders.
- Idea Day: Write [[Daily Notes/Evergreen Notes\|Evergreen Notes]] first thing in the Morning Routine, then progress into open exploration -> Maintenance(Email, Scheduling), and lastly social
