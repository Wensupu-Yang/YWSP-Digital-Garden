Preferred Future is a future thinking method developed by By [[Ronald Lippitt\|Ronald Lippitt]] & [[Edward Lindaman\|Edward Lindaman]]

> A scenario addresses the head, but a vision addresses the heart.

## Origianl Process
>1. Review the organization’s common history to create a shared appreciation.
>2. Identify what’s working and what’s not. Brainstorm and list ”prouds” and ”sorries.”
>3. Identify underlying values and beliefs, and discuss which ones to keep and which to abandon.
>4. Identify relevant events, developments, and trends that may have an impact on moving to a preferred future.
>5. Create a preferred future vision that is clear, detailed, and commonly understood. All participants, or at least a critical mass, should feel a sense of investment or ownership in the vision.
>6. Translate future visions into action goals.
>7. Plan for action: Build in specific planned steps with accountabilities identified.
>8. Create a structure for implementing the plan, with mid-course corrections, celebrations, and publicizing of SLK- cesses.

## Five stage
> (1) identification of problems, 
> (2) identification of past successes, 
> (3)identification of desires for the future, 
> \(4) identification of measurable goals, and 
> (5) identification of resources to achieve those goals.
> By Clement Bezold, president of the Institute for Alternative Futures

## Discussion
To be effective, the vision need to shared, and particapant need to believe it is achiveable
