## A story about stories 

Linearity, Famility Sturecure

The power of Story, create risks of limitation

Story of Auxin

Start with Darwin, Power of Movement in Plants
Bending of plant

Auxin: Do many opposites for root and shoots

Auxin, the main protagonist, does many things, with no causative narrative -> Unsatisfying, peak curiosity, but no resolution

How does Ausin control plant development?

Once upon a time, a cell met a signal
	Signal Transduction
	Phosphorylation cascades
	Preception ->Transduction -> Response

Genetics: Phone-a-friend of Biology
	What genes are necessary for process of interest
	Arabidopsis as a model
	Take away the plant's ability to respond to Auxin

Shock and Horror at the time
	transcription repressor family

Almost never happens in science: You have a hypothesis, design an experiment, and the hypothsis is validated

Molecular Glue

None of those happens

Negative feedback loop
	Auxin Signal Transduction 
	modulates flux through a cycle
	dynamic process: how much, how quickly, and in what direction are auxin levels changing

Helpful, then Misleading

The story you tell don't constrain your thinking

### Science Policy Landscape
#### Research careers
You go to Uni and never leave
	gate-keeper by competitive and focused on narrow criterias
	Obsessed with fairness, unintended consequence: relevence
	Less and less fun/creativity

Story of Leaky Pipeline
	Diversity at the Prof. and Lecture level is much less than undergrad
	Bring back, or get rid of the line

Network model of Researcher career 

Fix assessment criteria to support career path diversity

#### Innovation
Conceptualize as linear process
Discovery -> Product
Backfeed: Industry to Research

Valley of death

Segregation of people in academia, industy, and investment 
Silo of information flow, skills, know-how, and knowledge

#### National Prosperity
constructing the linear narrative, not just focus on input-output

Highly skilled prospering people

Tax Spending as Amplifier: R&D, Public Procurement

You can tell it linear story in a multiple way

Science and Technology Framework: 
Powered and Empower by science

Power of narrative and story, tell new stories when old one not working, tell complex way from multiple ways, 


Tech reconcile
Pansystem responsibility 
UKRI 

What have they done to 
	contribute new knowledge
	Support people

Transparently compare candidates with non-traditional research path 

People get security by checking those boxes, but the Boxes is actually undermining their security

Permission to do it good thing
