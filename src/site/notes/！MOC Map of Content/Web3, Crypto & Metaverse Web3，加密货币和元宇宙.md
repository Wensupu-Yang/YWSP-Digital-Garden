[[UX\|UX]] is not friendly to even the tech savvy. 
Sigture is not reader friendly
Mnemonics is very different then the password experience in Web2 and no way to recover noncustodial wallet

## Big Question
**Is Web3 were to be successful in next 3~5 years, what are some signs of good product?**

Public Goods like open source software and writing/media content, becasue their non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature, traditionally impossible caputure value.

Web3 may provide a channal to do so.
