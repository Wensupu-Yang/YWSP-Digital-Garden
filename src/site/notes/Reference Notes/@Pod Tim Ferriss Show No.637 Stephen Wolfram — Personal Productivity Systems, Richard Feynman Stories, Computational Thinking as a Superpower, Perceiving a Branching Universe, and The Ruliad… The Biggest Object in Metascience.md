## Quotes

> The thing to understand about translation, ultimately, is the destination mind isn’t built the same way the source mind is necessarily built.

> I realized I’d been working more than 12 hours a day, every day, for basically all of the last 50 years. And I’m having a good time, and I’ve been lucky enough to be able to mostly do things that add energy to me rather than taking it away.
