> _Thinking content_ encompasses one’s worldview—what one believes to be true about how the world works

> _Thinking style_ influences how one approaches the work at hand, interacts with teammates and stakeholders, and communicates learnings to the organization.

Tools to evaluate thinking style: 
	Kirton Adaptor-Innovator Assessment (KAI), 
	Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), and 
	Hermann Brain Dominance Inventory (HBDI) 
		> Investigators are great at research, but prone to “paralysis by analysis.”
		> Creators are great at coming up with lots of ideas but typically don’t show a lot of concern for their practicality or for following up on them.
		> Evaluators are great at organizing, planning, and seeing the flaws of an idea, but often lose sight of the big picture by excessive focus on the details.
		> Activators are great at networking and knowing how to get things done, but are often seen as overly emotional or more concerned with feelings than the bottom line.
		
> Social systems belong to the class called multi-loop nonlinear feedback systems

> “For every problem there is one solution which is simple, neat, and wrong.” —H. L. Mencken

> DIFFERENT CHANGES OCCUR AT DIFFERENT RATES AND WILL HAVE DIFFERENT IMPACTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES
