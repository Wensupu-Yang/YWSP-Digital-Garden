### Q&A
-  why why should we do artifacts? 
	- The More strategies the better
	- why do we practice foresight at all?
		- To understand 
		- To navigate appropriate action
	-  Three dimensions of foresight 
		- Different: how it is different from the present?
			- Signal scanning
		- Diversity: uncertainty in the system
			- Scenario Planning
		- Depth: Look and Feel of possible trajectories
			- Artifacts, Games, Experiential Futures (speculative design
- What's the desired outcome/ result?
	- Exploration
	- Education
	- Evangelism
	- Entertainment
	- Experimentation 
	- There is no one reason to do it.
