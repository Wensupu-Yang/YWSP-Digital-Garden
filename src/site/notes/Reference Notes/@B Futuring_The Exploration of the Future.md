>  how an effort to see the future can reveal the present, enabling people to correct their out-of-date beliefs and practices.
>  Pg 42

### Lessons from the Great Explorers
> "Many people today think that we can know nothing about the future. They are 99.999++ percent right in the literal sense, but quite wrong in the practical sense: Almost everything we don't know about the future has little practical importance to us, whereas the little that we can know is extremely important because it can help us make better decisions."
> Pg 3


> On **[[！Evergreen Notes/Productive Dreaming 有用的白日梦\|Productive Dreaming 有用的白日梦]]**
> "For the great explorers, dreaming was not idle reverie but research- a mental exploration of what lay ahead. By fantasizing about future events, they could explore alternative goals and strategies and thus develop and select worthwhile and achievable goals, as well as imaginative but realistic strategies for reaching the goals they selected.
> Pg 7

> **concept of culture**
> "Anthropologists define culture as the socially transmitted knowledge and practices of a group of people, and it is all-important in human life."
> Pg13

> The Problems of Progress
> In general, what we call “progress” can lead to abuse of the natural environment, the burden of learning new jobs, and general disorientation due to change itself:
> Pg 31

> Though change is normally our focus, we have to recognize that much remains constant, and it is this continuity that allows us to anticipate future events and plan what we should do.
> Pg 48


### Chance & Choas
Anecdote: 
- Frank Wills, Security guard, 1972, June 17 -> [[Watergate scandal\|Watergate scandal]]
- The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand

> Chance is important in scientific research because scientists often do not know exactly where to find what they are looking for. The trick is to look in places that logic or experience suggest but to be ready to pounce if the desired answer, or some other interesting result, turns up in a very unexpected way.
> Pg 56

Implication: 
- Ordinary people can produce miracles. Our action does have impacts, just don't know the influence is good or bad
- Future is not Singular bur multitudinous

> The historian focuses on the actualities of the past; the futurist must deal with the infinitely more numerous potentiali- ties of the future
> Pg 62

## Wild Cards

## First Futurist 
> Thucydides, the greatest of the ancient Greek historians, can also be regarded as possibly the first futurist, because he did not write his histories simply to recount events for the entertain- ment of readers, but rather to provide guidance for the future.
